# IEM-Electronics

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the electronics projects within IEM. This repository will house all the code, schematics, documentation, etc. related to the electronics systems in our vehicle. Below you can find an overview of the different projects within this repository:

## Projects

### 1. BLDC Motor Controller
The BLDC (Brushless DC) Motor Controller is being designed to efficiently control the speed and torque of the brushless motor that will be used in our vehicle. This project directory will include:
- **Software**: Code for the microcontroller to manage the motor speed, direction, and other parameters.
- **Schematics and Layout**: Circuit schematics and the PCB layouts.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations of the control algorithms and hardware design.

### 2. Brushed Motor Controller
The Brushed Motor Controller manages the operation of a brushed DC motor, ensuring optimal performance and reliability. This project directory will include:
- **Software**: The microcontroller code for the PWM control.
- **Schematics and Layout**: Circuit schematics and the PCB layouts.
- **Documentation**: Description of implementation, hardware components, and the control algorithm.

### 3. Driver Display
The Driver Display provides real-time feedback and information to the driver, such as speed, battery status, etc. This project directory will include:
- **Software**: The code for the display microcontroller which handles user interface and data presentation.
- **Schematics and Layout**: Circuit schematics and the PCB layout for the display module.
- **Documentation**: Description of hardware implementation, hardware components, interface descriptions, and the development notes.

### 4. Safety Circuit
The Safety Circuit is crucial for ensuring the safe operation of the vehicle, handling emergency vehicle stops, and monitoring critical system parameters. This project directory will include:
- **Software**: The code to monitor and respond to various safety signals.
- **Schematics and Layout**: Circuit schematics and the PCB layout for the safety circuit.
- **Documentation**: Details regarding safety protocols, response mechanisms, and compliance with the Shell Eco Marathon safety standards.

### 5. Telemetry
The Telemetry system is responsible for collecting and transmitting crutial data from the vehicle to a remote monitoring station. This project directory will include:
- **Software**: The code for data acquisition, processing, and wireless communication.
- **Schematics**: Circuit schematics and the PCB layout for the telemetry hardware.
- **Documentation**: This will include the data formats, transmission protocols, and integration guidelines.

### 6. Battery Management System *NEW*
The Battery Management System is essential for the monitoring and control of the custom battery used in our excellent vehicle, boasting industry-leading performance-per-watt (insert vague and bullshit graphs - Apple knows a lot about it). Protection and conditioning must be implemented to comply with competition regulations and ensure Paul Norman (and the EEE department) don't lose their shit. 
- **Software**: As a new project, this will involve writing C code for the microcontroller responsible for translating cell data to the CAN bus interface.
- **Schematic**: A highly original design with our humble logo plasted all over it - maybe clarkson makes an appearance RIP Jezza, Hamster and Captain Slow it was a fantastic 22 years.
- **Documentation**: The above? Legal, standards, datasheets?

The OneNote also shows more detail of these systems, if filled out.
